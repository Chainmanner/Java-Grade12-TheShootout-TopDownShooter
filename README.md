# Java-Grade12-TheShootout-TopDownShooter
This is the final group assignment of Grade 12 - a top-down shooter with playable levels and cutscenes, built in Eclipse and using Java's Swing API for the graphics. Programming was mainly done by me, while artwork and playtesting was done primarily by my partner. The engine is functional for the purposes of the assignment, but the game's plotline and certain additional features (e.g. double-buffering, better music transition, performance optimizations, better enemy AI, etc.) could not be completed by the due date.

More information in the Case Study file included.

Music was taken from:
  - The Thing (2002 video game)
  - The Darkness (2007 video game)
