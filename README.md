# Java-Grade12-TheShootout-TopDownShooter
This is the final group assignment of Grade 12 - a top-down shooter with playable levels and cutscenes, built in Eclipse and using Java's Swing API for the graphics. Programming was mainly done by me, while artwork and playtesting was done primarily by my partner. The engine is functional for the purposes of the assignment, but the game's plotline and certain additional features (e.g. double-buffering, better music transition, performance optimizations, better enemy AI, etc.) could not be completed by the due date.

All files are packed in "Unit RST.zip" (created using 7-Zip with maximum compression used), since for some reason GitHub has problems when I try to upload file folders. Some music also had to be removed from the ZIP file to fit within GitHub's size constraints.

Game instructions will be displayed in-game.

For optimal performance, please close other resource-intensive programs. YouTube players especially are a significant source of lag.

More information in the Case Study file included, but not all of the document was updated in time by the due date, so it would be better to instead look through the .java files and read the comments to understand how the game works.

Music was taken from:
  - The Thing (2002 video game)
  - The Darkness (2007 video game)
